#General description
This is a quick'n'dirty application draft that has been developed in order to test the behavior of the Android operating system when having to deal with a high volume of data traffic and of SMS messages over a short period of time.

#SMS Tests
When running SMS sending tests the user should bear in mind that there is a limit on the number of SMS that that can be scheduled by a single application over a set amount of time, before requiring manual confirmation. The number of allowed SMS depends on the API level of the Android version that the user is currently running. It is possible to increase this value (by a small margin) by selecting the desired SMS message limit from Setting -> Security -> Miscellaneous.
If the device being used for the tests is rooted, it is possible to remove the limit check by accessing /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases/settings.db database and by inserting a new record using the following SQL command "INSERT INTO gservices (name, value) VALUES(‘sms_outgoing_check_interval_ms’, 0);".
Finally experimental tests have shown that the process com.android.phone might when generating a high volume of SMS traffic over a short time span, depending on the user's configuration.
